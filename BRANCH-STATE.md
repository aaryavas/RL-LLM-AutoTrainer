# TODOS
- On initial start, the text columns are not able to be triggered. If you reach an error state and go back, that's the only time it is. 
- No logging for error state (make sure to have this in a gitignore)
- Labels do not have text fields and an option for more
- Same thing with label -- it's basically just an empty page
- Examples too -- we're supposed to have a pop-up if you look properly at the cli logic
- Select model is working as expected, though the defaults (number of tokens per sample, sample, batch size) should be customizible when they are currently not
- The rectangle at the bottom with the Tab | Enter | Esc: Back is too small and actually cuts off where the text starts (vertically)
